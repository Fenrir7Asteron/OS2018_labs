In the first case "Hello" will be printed twice because before the fork() system call stdout buffer has "Hello", hence a copy of an original process will also has a "Hello" inside its buffer. Later both buffers are flushed with "\n". In the second case "Hello" is flushed from the buffer before the fork(), hence the second process copies an empty buffer and overall there will be only one "Hello" printed.
